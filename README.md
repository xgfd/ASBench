# Script Naming Conventions

Several scripts are used to retrieve RDF graphs of certain shapes. More descriptions can be found in each script.

Script name describes the composition of a RDF chain. The following abbreviation are used:

x{n} = xx...x repeat n times

c = class

i = instance

p = nodes connected by any property

np = nodes connected by numerical property

e.g. ci4cp.sh = Retrieve all triples that form a chain of a length of 6, with the start and end nodes being classes,  intermediate nodes being instances, and connected by any property.
